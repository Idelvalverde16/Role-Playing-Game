# Role-Playing-Game
Learning basic javascript by building a role playing game.

JavaScript is a powerful scripting language that can be used to make web pages interactive. It's one of the core technologies of the web, along with HTML and CSS. All modern browsers support JavaScript.

In this practice project, I learned fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript by coding my own Role Playing Game. I learned how to work with arrays, strings, objects, functions, loops, if/else statements, and more. Practicing in https://www.freecodecamp.org.
